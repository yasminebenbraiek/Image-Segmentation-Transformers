# Medical Transformers

Welcome to the Medical Transformers Exploration repository, focusing on the LeViT-UNet model. The goal of this project is to provide a simplified and accessible way for everyone to explore and understand the capabilities of the LeViT-UNet model in the medical domain.

## LeViT-UNet Notebook

Explore the potential of the LeViT-UNet model using the provided notebook. This notebook is designed to guide you through the functionalities of the model, with an emphasis on medical image processing.

## Original GitHub and Research Paper

- https://github.com/apple1986/LeViT-UNet : Visit the original repository for more in-depth details about the LeViT-UNet model, its architecture, and additional resources.

- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08623.pdf : Refer to the research paper associated with the LeViT-UNet model for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles and methodologies.

## Accessibility via Colab

To make it easier for users, I've created a Google Colab notebook that eliminates the complexities of setting up the environment locally. Now, you can seamlessly explore the LeViT-UNet model without any hassle.

## Getting Started

1. Open the LeViT-UNet notebook in the Colab environment.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to explore the capabilities of the LeViT-UNet model for medical image analysis.

## Usage

Feel free to use, modify, and share the notebook. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please create an issue or pull request.

Note: The original model may have specific requirements or dependencies. Make sure to check the instructions within the notebook for any additional setup needed.

Happy exploring into the world of medical transformers!
